# Project 1 Instructions:

## Goal:
  
  * Build something awesome

  * Improve your front-end and Git skills

## Requirements:

  * Must use at least two APIs

    * _Test them first to make sure they work the way you want!_ Some APIs don't support "CORS" (cross-origin sharing).

  * Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we haven't discussed

    * Firebase may count as your new technology

    * Also look into Materialize as an alternative to Bootstrap

  * Must have a polished front-end / UI

  * Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)

  * Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals!)

  * Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc)

  * Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

  * Must have user input validation / check for errors

## Presentation Date:

  * One Week from today (June 6th)

    * Presentations will be recorded, so you _must_ use the instructor's laptop to demo it.
